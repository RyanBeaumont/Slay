Opportunity for a local band?
Hi Name,
My name is Ryan and I play with a 4-piece Denver indie rock band called Recipe 4 Disaster. 
We've been in the Denver scene for about a year playing local venues like Bar 404, Lost Lake, and Larimer Lounge. 
If you are looking for an opener, or a local band to fill out a bill, let me know - we'd love to have a chance to play at [venue].
